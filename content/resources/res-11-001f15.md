description: A chart showing the interdependence of technology, supply systems, the
  change agent, and the user in product evaluation. These four elements, along with
  the stakeholders and macro level drivers, will determine if a product will be widely
  adopted. CITE attempts to model the interaction between these entities to predict
  a product's success in the developing world. Image by MIT OCW, adapted from CITE.
